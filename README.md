Publication Quality Symbols - FSM, Timing Diagrams, Comb/Synchronous Logic gates, Control Systems blocks for KiCad.

When LibreDraw, Visio, WaveDrom, timing fonts, state machine editors, and everything else just doesn't cut it.  

Useful for creating documentation and as an aid for FPGA/ASIC design, Control System design, etc. KiCad's wonderful plotter can export DXF, SVG, PDF, etc. for technical publication in TeX or other tools.
